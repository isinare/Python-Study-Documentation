#short circuiting
is_friend = True
is_user = True

#   this is called short circuiting...in this case if is_friend is true is_user is ignored which makes it more efficient
# if is_friend or is_user:
#    print('best friends forever')

#   what u should use depends on your need
# if is_friend and is_user:
#     print('BEST FRIENDS FOREVER')
