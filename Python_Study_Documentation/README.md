Python_Study_Documentation
Study Documentation for the basics of python.

Hello, I am Ishan Sinare, And this is a simple documentation that I have made for python throughout the udemy courses, that I have taken on subject,
Currently a bit over 10 hours have been put into this documentation, and 2 editors have been tried in the duration.

Anyone who knows python should easily be able to revise the concepts from this simple piece of documentation

this whole file covers a lot of the fundamentals of python programming.
the code editor which was used to make this document is osscode(fork of VS code)
repl.io was also used to make some part of this document.

Developer fundamentals is a primary part of this file. it includes things like
Good and clean code writing
parameters and arguments
functions
methods
suggestions to write good code with functions and methods etc.
args and kwargs
operators
etc.

data types covers all the 4 basic data types and their operators and parameters, methods as well as functions.

excercises has some easily made basic python programs(not really useful but made them for practice)

Maths has everything that has to do with arithematics.
it has the multiple things including the order of operators in a functions

strings has many things about strings, sequences, expressions and statements and formatted strings etc.

I have made this document with the hopes that this will help me learn python in a journey that I guess to be over a 100 hours in total, and to reflect on how much 
I have learned since I started this documentation,
This Documentation is a private documentation to be viewed only by Ishan.R.Sinare.
Thank You.
